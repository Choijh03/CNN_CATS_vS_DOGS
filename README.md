# CNN_CATS_vS_DOGS

This was Second Machine Learning project using Jupyter Noter book in Anaconda (same as CNN_CARS_VS_MOTORCYCLES)

Tensorflow concept was used to distinguish 2 different objects (cats vs dogs).

One error foudn was that sometimes pictures setting says JPEG or JPG, they are not really in JPEG or JPG.

To solve this issue, one new mehtod can be used to convert any format of pictures into JPEG or JPG or PNG before feeding any data to the machine.
